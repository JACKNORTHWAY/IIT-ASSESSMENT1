<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3> <br>
 I have always had an interest in the latest and greatest in IT, but I don’t Identify myself as an IT guru. I am more a rock music guru. I can identify the smallest parts in guitars just by looking at a glimpse of the guitar. My poor girlfriend has to listen to me go “Ow, Bob Spencer has P-90 Pickups in his guitar” or “Gee Prince is a great Guitarist.”

But even though I wouldn’t Identify as a IT Guru. I do find myself keeping up to date on all the latest and greatest in Tech. I watch a lot of YouTube. Some of the channels I watch is “Linus Tech Tips, Tom Scott, Marques Brownlee, Jim Browning and many others.

I love researching new Technology, recently I have been researching about laptops, as I am currently in the market for one. I like the new Apple MacBooks with the M2 Chip. But have found the price to worth ratio to be very high. More Likely to upgrade to another Dell Laptop.

My interest in IT has grown more in recent times, as I found a new interest in programming. As I have been trusted in work to program Fire Indicator Panels. Ill make a program on the manufacturer’s software and upload it to the Fire panel. Even though it requires no coding I do find coding to be very interesting.

    <h3>When did your interest in IT Start?</h3> <br>
    My interest in IT Started from a young age bumming around on the Family computer. I have been known to break computers by my curiosity. As a kid I was trying to clean up my computer and accidentally deleted System 32. Which in the progress crashed the computer.
    Back when I was a young teenager most of my friends were playing Call of Duty Black Ops, on the Xbox 360. A friend and I couldn’t play with the others cause we both had the generation 1 of the X-box 360 which only had an Ethernet port on the back of the console. After a bit of research, I learnt that you could connect the Generation 1 Xbox 360 to the internet by connecting a laptop to the Xbox via the ethernet port and bridging it with the laptops wifi connection. It was a game changer and introduced me to the Console online gaming world.

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3> <br>
I didn’t necessarily choose RMIT. I had a day off from work and I got a phone call from Open University’s cold calling to find new customers. I got talking to the person on the phone and they asked if I was to study what would I like to do. I responded with Engineering. But was shut down due to fact I would be studying online due to having a job.

I made mention that I’m interested in Programming and the Open University’s rep recommended Studying Information Technology. And from which I signed up and they signed me up to RMIT. I am glad they signed me up to RMIT cause by what I have heard, there the “working mans university”.

  <h3>  What do I expect to learn during your study’s? </h3>
	I’m not 100% sure on what I expect to Learn.
I am hoping to learn how to code and program software and the integration of those in everyday software. But maybe later in the Introduction to Technology I find something I would like to pursuit.

<strong> My Strategy:</strong> Confident Individualism <br>



<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3> <br>
The Results of the test just reiterate on what I already expected for myself. <br>



<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3> <br>
The results could influence a team by showing others what my personality and learning style is, so we could all work within our strongest points about ourselves. <br>


<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3> <br>
If a team of people all have different weakness and strong points it should work well as a whole group as we would be working at the most optimum point. <br>

  <h1>  Project Idea </h1>
<p>

<strong>IT project idea:</strong> Wireless Serial Adaptor, to program Fire Panels <br>


The Idea is to create a Bluetooth to Serial Adaptor. A way to transfer data to an Appliance such as a Fire Panel. In today’s PC’s they don’t generally come with Serial Port. And the only way to connect a PC to a Fire Panel, is Via a USB to Serial Adaptor. And or use an Older Computer that is compatible with Serial.


My idea was sprung into my mind when I was Programming a Fire Indicator Panel and had to Use Multiple Adaptors to convert Serial to USB to Program a Fire Panel via its Serial Port.
The thinking is why can’t I just have a Serial to Bluetooth Adaptor and manipulate the computer to think I’ve just connected the Adaptor in as if it was a cable.

The need to use Multiple Cables makes more points of failure, reducing the reliability of the cable when sending Data during a Program change.

The Motivation for this Idea is to create less points of failure, and to make programming an Appliance such as a Fire Panel Easier by only needing to plug in a Wireless Adaptor on the Appliance side.

The tools and Technology’s needed is to convert Serial into a Wireless Signal, such as Bluetooth or WIFI. And then decode the data on the PC side and make the Software send and receive the data. Essentially, I don’t want a cable and I just want a Little Adaptor that I can plug into serial.

Skills required would be to come electronic work, to connect serial adaptor to a Wireless Module.
And a program that can decode the data and make the laptop be able to read the Data

If the project is successful, I and many other Technicians would have 2 less cables in our laptop bag being tangled up with who knows what. And might make the Fire Panel Manufactures rethink the idea of using Serial and maybe the new generation of Fire Panels will have wireless compatibility’s
